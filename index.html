    <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/">Birkbeck College</a>, London.

    The lectures are free to attend and all are welcome (no registration is
    required).

   <h2>The Lectures</h2>
   <h3>The Realm of Epistemic Ends</h3>
   <p>
     Epistemic agents are ineluctably interdependent. We are nodes in epistemic networks,
   supporting and supported by others. Via testimony we convey and glean information. We
   teach and learn from others – not just facts but also techniques, strategies, standards, and
   skills that are vital to our understanding of the world. Each of us relies on methods and
   devices that she could never have invented, validated, or calibrated on her own. If epistemic
   autonomy requires complete independence, it is a chimera. But if autonomy is a matter of
   self-government, our situation is different. The autonomous agent, Kant maintains, makes the
   rules that bind her. She does so not in isolation, but as a legislating member of a realm of
   ends – that is, as one among many who jointly ratify those rules. Building on the account of
   epistemic normativity I presented in True Enough, I will argue that epistemic communities are
   quasi-Kantian communities of epistemic ends. Members of such communities are
   autonomous epistemic agents who collectively certify epistemic norms by justifying those
   norms to one another. I will show that the constraints on a realm of ends insure that this does
   not make knowledge or understanding relativistic or subjective. Epistemic autonomy and
   epistemic interdependence are mutually supportive.
